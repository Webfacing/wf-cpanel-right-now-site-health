## Known limitations

- Links to documentation to resolve reported issues are shown to PRO ISP AS customers only.
- This plugin will probably not report much if the site is not on a cPanel¬Æ managed server, but will do the test for HTTPS only.
- Resource gauges in dashboard widget suffers interference from [Site Kit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/) plugin by Google. Gauges not shown.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add database tables, store options or adding lines to `wp-config.php`? =

No, not, none.

= Does it require my login information to cPanel¬Æ? =

No.

= What if I don't want the (new) cPanel¬Æ Resource Usage widget (gauges)?

Close it with the up arrow icon, or hide it using Screen Options (the top right hidden panel) - as usual. No data will be fetched from cPanel¬Æ while widget is closed or hidden.

= Does it work on other web hosts than PRO ISP? =

Yes, at least on some, but not tested much. Please report your experience. Use Reviews, Support or GitHub.

= Does it work without cPanel¬Æ? =

Very, very limited. The 'HTTPS only' security test should work, and disk used info, but max space test will not be performed and the result will just show 'N/A'.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

Yes, visit it's [Github repo](https://github.com/Nettvendt/wf-cpanel-right-now-site-health) and create an issue, clone it and/or file a pull request.
